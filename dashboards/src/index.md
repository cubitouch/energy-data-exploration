## Data sources

The national level data published [here](https://ecologie.data.gouv.fr/datasets/55f0463d88ee3849f5a46ec1) includes, among other things:

- Energy usage and estimates (D and D-1)
- Usage breakdown by energy type (coal, wind, solar, etc.)
- Corresponding COâ‚‚ ratio
- Country of origin for the energy usage

The data is recorded in 15-minute intervals and spans from early 2023 onward. New data becomes available throughout the day, but this dashboard is refreshed only once per night.
